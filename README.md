This is a small collection of scripts that eventually will be merged in to a much greater toolset. My end goal is to eventually replace the current closed
source tool (CBSM) with an open source platform that the server operators can then host on their own systems.

Setup:
- Start by configuring variables under includes/config.php and includes/dbConn.php.
- Modify the absolute path to log files under 7daysManager and 7daysManager.php (This will probably be moved in to a config file eventually).
